# Movie/TV show Recommendations


## Description of Deliverable


### Elevator Pitch

With all the new streaming services offered on the internet, trying to find good Movies and TV Shows is an extremely long and difficult process. The ***Movie Recommendation application*** allows users to login, select movies they have watched in the past, rate the movies, recieve a list of Movies and TV shows recommended for them, and provide a link **straight to the streaming service** that is showing that piece of media. Once a user has made their initial ratings of movies, they can continue to add to their watched Movies and TV/shows list so that they can recieve better recommendations. Users can also add movies to their watchlist so they can store which movies they may be interested in and view the media later.
